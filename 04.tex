\section{Conclusion}

This article describes the Tick function and its inversion. We created 
an explicit formula for the nth derivation (\ref{awesome}) of this function,
and we created a summation representation (\ref{q}) of this function.

We found an explicit formula for the nth derivative (\ref{w},\ref{e}) of the
T function and partially for inversion of the Thick function.
