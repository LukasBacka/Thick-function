We denote by Λ the set of n-tuples (λ1,...,λn), λ1,...,λn ∈ R for which the equation eλ1 e···λn-1 eλn x -z = 0 has exact two real solutions. In fact, one of them is an attracting fixed point of eλ1 e···λn-1 eλn x which is denoted by q. We also show that when (λ1,...,lambdan) ∈ Λ, the Julia set of eλ1 e···λn-1 eλn x is the complement of the basin of attraction of q. The ideas used in this note may also be applicable to more general functions.},
